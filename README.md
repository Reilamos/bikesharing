Citi Bike program in New York

## Resources

- Tableau Public 2022.1
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8

## Overview

We want to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solify the proposal I have created a bike trip analysis using NYC Citibike Data. 

- In Deliverable 1 I used Jupyter Notebook to change Trip Duration to the Datetime Format.
- In Deliverable 2 I created Visualisations for the Trip Analysis.
- In Deliverable 3 I will use visuals from the module and the challenge to create a story in Tableau.

## Results

### Deliverable 1

Converted tripduration to datetime and created a new CSV file without the index:
